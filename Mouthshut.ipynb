       " '\\nDear AllOur sincere advice to all those who invest in this brand “SPECIFICALLY AT KINGSWAY RAILWAY STATION BRANCH OF NAGPUR”……. Pls beware!!!!!Incase you buy a gemstone, even if it is in the “7 day return period”, this branch will deduct all your making charges, other taxes and charges and cheat you!All in “charge” from kingsway branch ALWAYS create problems for the customer. They always makes things very difficult and frustrating. All that is very much in accordance with the policies also this branch hides from you. There is no transparency in the selling procedure. When it comes to exchange and selling, they show their true colours.This experience has been a regular feature now. We have travelled in so many cities…nowhere in any branch of Tanishq do the branch manager, accounts handling team or the any other staff create such nuisance for the customers….that too regularly visiting customers!!!!!Every product is eligible for one exchange within 7 days….even if it is a gemstone…..but this branch has its own rules. You will have to go back. They will tell you that an approval will be needed which will take a few days, then Incase all goes well, we will see…..you can come back even if it means travelling 1 hour one way second time.Customer service and support is so pathetic!!!! Do you even have the time to come back again and again. We stay 40 kms away from this branch and they make us travel so many times just for such petty issues time and again.We have been deceived so many times now that it is much better to go to a local store instead of wasting sooooooo much money in this store.Please explore other branches and other brands too before getting followed with the brand name.We will not come back to “KINGWAY, STATION ROAD” branch again!!!!!!These people do not even cooperate with other branches of the same brand. They say that we have our own rules!!!!!!!Can you believe this…!Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You! We appreciate your effort.\\n',\n",
